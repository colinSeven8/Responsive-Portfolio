            <p>Greetings, humans. I know that this old high school picture of me probably looks like I'm saying, "hey,
                dude", but I'm really not. Back then, having bleached hair and sideburns was a thing - not so much now.
            </p>
            <p>Some of my interests include artwork, soccer, biking, skateboarding, snowboarding, running around in the
                mountains, and melting faces with my guitar. I've been interested in coding for a long time, and have
                written small applications independently here and there over the years. I was introduced to Web
                development a couple of years ago and decided this is the way to go. I'm really excited to finally get
                the formal training I've wanted.</p>
